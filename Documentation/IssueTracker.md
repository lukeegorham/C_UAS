# Issue Tracker

### Description:
This file is a running list of all known issues, sorted by subsystem

## Acoustics/Radar Simulator
- The acoustics hub currently sends messages to the simulator, which then processes and re-transmits to the GroundStation 1 Laptop. The acoustic hub will eventually be implemented to send data to the GS1 laptop directly.

## Acoustics System (Hub and Pods)

## C2 System
- Network Readme needs to be populated with ports for all systems
- Power readme needs creating
    - Use pictures for clarity
- Add functionality to have GS1 accept acoustic data directly, rather than passing through Acoustic/Radar Sim
- Link for fly-to-waypoint functionality
- Sensor Fusion Module
- Kalman Filtering Module

## Discovery Drone
- Build a 650 drone
- Scripts working on NVIDIA board
- Fly-to-waypoint functionality in DroneMaster.py

## Ground Camera
- Exposure set too high
- Missing functionality to point given a direction and elevation
- Missing functionality to be aimed by buttons on GUI

## GUI
-
