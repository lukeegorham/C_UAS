# Welcome to CUAS Capstone!
Congratulations on finding the main documentation center. Linked below are all the documentation files created by the 2021-2022 team, hopefully they will begin to give you an idea of the scope and how to begin working on each subsystem.

We recommend that you begin with an [overview](ProjSubsystemInfo.md) of the project to familiarize yourself with the main system components and how they interact. Then dive into each of the systems or other documents based on your AOR on the team.

## Documentation Links:
* [Overview](ProjSubsystemInfo.md) - a good place to start, includes scope of the project
* [Install](InstallSoftware.md) - get your hardware up and running with our software, and how to best debug
* [Power System](PowerSystem.md) - understand hardware for field setup and how to power in the lab
* [Network](Network.md) - organized by subsystem, includes IP addresses and Ports for each connection
* [Field Operations](FieldOpsInstructions.md) - now that you're ready for a test, here's how
* [Image Processing](ImageProcessing.md) - process for detecting presence and position of an incoming drone
* [Sensor Fusion](SensorFusion.md) - process for estimating future positions based upon current position and velocity
* [Issue Tracker](IssueTracker.md) - running list of current known issues per system
## Subsystems:
* [Acoustic/Radar Simulator](../AcousticPodRadarSim/SIM_README.md)
* [Acoustic Hub/Pods](../AcousticPodRadarSim/POD_README.md)
* [C2](../GroundStation/C2_README.md)
* [Discovery Drone]()
* [Ground Camera]()
* [GUI]()
